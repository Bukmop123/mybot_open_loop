Step 1: Preparation
1: connect the 
	motors, 
	circuit, 
	arduino, 
	raspberry together and turn the power on

2: start the computer and connect to the internet


Step 2: ssh connection to raspberry
1: insert the LAN cable in the raspberry
2: wait until the orange and green light are visible

3: open a terminal and type:
	cd ~/mybot_ws

4: start the script: (with passwort for raspberry: raspberry)
	./ssh-cpmbot-control.sh
	
you are connected to the raspberry through a terminal.

Step 3: start ros in raspberry
1:  type:
	cd ~/mybot_ws

2: start ros with: (with passwort for raspberry: raspberry)
	./run_open_loop_arduino.sh 




Step 4: read arduino feedback
1: repeat Step 2.3, 2.4 
2: type: 
	rostopic echo /mybot/detail/feedbackHardwareInterface

you know should be able to see the feedback from the arduino which looks like:
